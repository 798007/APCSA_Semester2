       <p>During quarantine I have been playing a lot of video games with my friends. Some of the games I've been playing the most are Apex Legends and Guitar Hero. I even convinced my dad to play Just Dance one night, which was pretty funny.</p>

       <div class= "Divs">
         <h2>2. Baking</h2>

       </div>
       <p>Over the past few weeks I've developed a baking addiction. Last night I literally made cookies and a cake at 2am because I was so bored. Nobody in my family is complaining though. They're happy to get free food.</p>

       <div class= "Divs">
         <h2>3. FaceTime</h2>

       </div>
       <p> I've really been missing being able to see my friends every day, but FaceTiming them has really helped a lot. It's nice being able to see them and talk to them. It has destroyed my sleep schedule though. Somehow, whenever I call my friends at night we all lose track of time and accidentally stay up until 5am. Oops.</p>

       <div class= "Divs">
         <h2>4. Netflix</h2>

       </div>
       <p> I've been watching a lot of Netflix shows with my mom recently. Here's a list of some of the shows we've been watching:</p>
       <ul>
         <li>Lucifer</li>
         <li>Outer Banks</li>
         <li>The Good Place</li>
       </ul>
